Html(Hyper-Text-Markup-Language):

Introduction:
Tim Berner Lee, Founder of Html.
A standard of presenting data.
Line - Mode browser was used as a medium of Browsing Data.
The Html files were downloaded and read from the local machine without the use of a GUI back then.
Command : Curl "URL" > "URL".html	
Html Tags are not Case Sensitive.
<!DOCTYPE HTML> tag boosts performance as it allows the Computer to recogonize the file as a html file without checking throught the entire document.
Two types of tags :
Atonic: <br>,no content
Composite: <>Content</>

SVG: Scalable vector graphics
It is used to provide simple graphical shapes to the html page
 
W3C manages standards used in HTML,JSON,XML and its protocols all over WWW

html tags are divided into 2 ,Input tags and Non input tags.
 
HTML provides 2 types of storage facility: Session storage(small)(short term)(cookies,tokens) and Local Storage(large)(Long term)(SQL DATABASE,).Both are not secure enough


Style tag can have multiple styles and style tags can be present in mpre than one section of the code.
Types of CSS StyleSheets: Inline>Internal>External

Types of selectors:
Universal selector
Element selector
Group selector(child selector)(div>p)
id selector
attribute selector
class selector
index selector(psuedo selector)(mouse events like hover,click)

Container Tags:(composite tag)
Html,Head,Div,Span,pre,p,u,b,i,form,table,img

JS CallBacks: Automated(Called by browser based on events),Manual(Called when required)

3UI Functions in JS:
windows.alert()--> Messages/Warnings
windows.promp()-->Take user input
windows.confirm()-->yes/no


DOM: Document Object Model
html tags as objects
allows the browser to understand the document with the help of dom tree.it is created by the browser


Built IN objects in JS:
Window
Document
History
Exception
Screen
Navigator
GeoLocation
LocalStorage
SessionStorage
Cookies
Frames
Forms
.
.
.
.
Console

<object>,Consists of composite variables.

Form level Validation
Field Level validation: 

userdefined event can be created in 2 ways:
using event class,using custom event class

React JS(open source framework developed by FaceBook) - create Reactive website
Node JS - server environment
Express JS -

ReactJS:
It has all the properties that html and css has and doesnt have.

Two types of components or two types of tags can be created : Functional component(Functional tag which performs an action) or class component(Performs more than one action).
The purpose of React is to create tags that perform Developer defined actions.

Only External Style sheets are allowed in React JS


Binding can be of 2 types :
One way Binding,Two way Binding

Loading updating{contents change} and unloading: process of browser Displaying html tags

Mounting,updating,unmounting

Use state for functional components,State is for class components

Hooks in react js: With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused.it reduces the code in a FIle.

Functional bootstrap 		

In express ,UI deevlopement is not recommended and is a tedious process to do so.

mssql
 options:{trustedConnection:true},
  driver:"msnodesqlv8",
  server:"200411LTP2750//SQLEXPRESS",
  database:"UserDetails",
  

Angular JS : 
open source,Uses typescript ,but used JS untill version 3 of angular,single,
Developed by angular.io and bought out by google .React js uses Angular features,object oriented programming possible 

File processing order : 
Package.Json-->main.ts-->index.html-->app.module.ts-->app.component.ts

Component = Collection of tags
every component will have a view that is html file and ll have one or more Css

By default angular follows External style sheets

CSS : internal ,external ,Inline


.ts file : 
Model Controller
.html : 
View
.css:
css
Create a Component:
ng generate component componentname
ng g c componentname

App component is the highest in hierarchy.The components others are just the child component of App component.
*Databinding:
{{}}-->oneway binding
[()]--> twoway binding
*Class binding : 
Attach a CSS class to a html tag
*Event binding:
Attach a function (controller) to a button or any other html tag
*property binding :
Attach a value to a html tag
*Attribute binding : 
use attributes in html tag
*Style binding : 
Use style in html tag


Types of Pipes
string pipe
currency pipe
decimal pipe
date pipe
JSON pipe
Internationalization
Two type of forms : template driven and reactive forms
ReactiveForms:
Based on the form ,Model is produced manually.
can perform validation without code.Dynamic code,
Template driven forms:
Static form .Model is produced automatically.We use built in attribute ng-form

FormControl definition :

userform = new FormGroup(
{
	/*defintion od teh fields in the model and also respective validations*/
	<fieldname>:new Form Control(<inital value>,[<validation1>,<validation2>...............<validationN>])..........
................................
.............................
	<fieldname2> : new FormControl(<initialValue>,[<Validation1>..............................,<ValidationN>])
},
{
		//Timing of Validation
		updateOn:<blur,change,submit>
}
);

COMPONENT LIFE CYCLE:

Initialization Phase (ngOnInit)(AfterViewInit)
Activation Phase (onActivate)
View or Display Phase(AfterViewInit)(AfterViewChecked)
Validation Phase(ngDoCheck)(AfterContentChecked)
Updation Phase(onUpdate)
Destroy Phase(onDestroy)


NODEJS:

It is a framework that is entirely written in JS.
It is a server platform.
it supports/Follows JS syntax.
A normal JS requires a browser to execute.Browser executes the normal JS code.A JS written using NodeJS doesnt require Browser.Instead it requires NodeJS t o run the script.
Node jS is used to run the JavaScript code on the server without the use of a Browser.
Node Js provides a light weight server environment to the javascript code.So execution is faster because of the light weight nature of NodeJS.
A JS code can be executed on command line also using NodeJS.
Like JS ,NodeJS doesn not support any DataType.


IMPORTING A MODULE:

VAR <MODULE REF> = REQUIRE ('<NAME OF THE MODULE>');

Built-IN modules: 
file,os,network,process

I18n:
 "i18n:extract" : "ng extract:i18n --output-path src/locale"
i18n is the package name
src/locale - consists of translation files for various languages

MongoDB:
Json :Lightest Data storage format
Json can be used for transmitting and storing structured data
RDBMS follows the definite structure for the data , NoSQL databases does not follow pre determined structure (The structure can be changed).

Taxonomy of NoSQL:
KeyValue : Redis,Riak
Graph Database:neo4j(apple) ,hypergraphdb
Document-Oriented:MongoDb,CouchDB
Column Family:Cassandra,HBase

Theory of NoSQL:
Nodes:Contain replicas of partitions
CAP-Consistency,Availability,Partition Tolerance(Satisifying all 3 is impossible).
Sharding: Single database ,distributed among multiple machines/servers .Gets updated when any one of the databse gets updated.

In NoSql ,a record is Called a document.
A set of documents is called a collection.
A set of collections is called a database.

Benefits of NoSQL:
Elastic scaling
DBA Specilists
Big data

mongod
mongosh
mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+2.0.2

In MongoDB , while inserting elements in to a collection unique object id is generated for each element entry.
